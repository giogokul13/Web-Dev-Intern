            Every element is a rectangular box, and there are several properties that determine the size of that box. The core of the box is defined by the width and height of an element, which may be determined by the display property, by the contents of the element, or by specified width and height properties. padding and then border expand the dimensions of the box outward from the element’s width and height. Lastly, any margin we have specified will follow the border.
