        <p id="para1"> The text-align property, however, should not be confused with the float property. The text-align values left and right will align 
            text within an element to the left or right, whereas the float values left and right will move the entire 
            element. Sometimes the text-align property will give us the desired outcome, and other times we may need to use the float property.
